Codex Arcana, Volume IV

STUDENTS AND SCHOLAR: Attend our Abjurations!$
SHOWING DUE PROPRIETY IN THE CUSTODY OF BOOKS$

We not only render service to the Emperor in preparing volumes of new books, but also exercise an office of sacred piety when we treat books carefully, and again when we restore them to their proper places and commend them to inviolable custody; that they may rejoice in purity while we have them in our hands, and rest securely when they are restored to their repositories.  And surely next to the vestments and engines dedicated to the Emperor's glory, arcane books deserve to be rightly treated by the battlemage, to which great injury is done so often as they are touched by unclean hands.  Wherefore we deem it expedient to warn our students against various negligences, such as might be easily avoided and which do wonderful harm to books.$

Being a continuance of a partial index of arcane contrivances known to the scholars and alchemists of Battlespire, that these contrivances might more readily be known to all students, and neither abused, nor neglected, nor wasted in their employment.$
