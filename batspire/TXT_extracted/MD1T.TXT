	MD1A11	Come here, little manling. I won't hurt you. I just want to tell you a... secret.	MD1A1A	TRUE			Report, you fool. What are you doing here? And who do you serve?	MD1A51				
	MD1A12	What are you? And what are you doing here. Come closer, so I can talk to you.	MD1A1B	TRUE			You're just the person I wanted to see. I  was supposed to give you this.... Now, what did I do with that package. Wait a second while I look in my bag....	END	MONSTERWAIT_30			
	MD1A13	Hmm. Welcome. I am very happy to see you. I have a present for you.	MD1A1C	&PCFemale			Don't be tedious.  I'm here searching for Josian Kaid. I've taken the form of a manling to trick him. Now go about your business as if you never saw me.	MD1A61				
			MD1A1D	&PCMale			Don't be tedious.  I'm here searching for Vatasha Trenelle. I've taken the form of a manling to trick her. Now go about your business as if you never saw me.	MD1A61				
			MD1A1E	TRUE			Among my kind I am accounted a great warrior and master of spellcraft. Come. Let us parlay first, take one another's measure in words, and then, if we must fight, let us fight with dignity and honor.	MD1A71				
	MD1A21	Well. It IS you, manling. I hear you are quite the little fireball. They say for us to capture you alive. I tend to get excited in a fight, so please remind me about the ALIVE part if I seem to get too excited.	MD1A2A	TRUE			Look. Are you SURE you're supposed to capture me alive? That's not what I heard. Who told you that?	MD1B21				
			MD1A2B	TRUE			I make it a policy not to beat up on poor, helpless idiots. Do you qualify?	END		&MorphMad		
			MD1A2C	&WearAmuletH OR &WearAmuletO OR &WearAmuletU			Look here, you pea-brained lummox. I got this amulet. That means I am NOT a manling. I am a very-well respected daedra, and you are going to get in a LOT  of trouble if you so much as breathe on me.	MD1A81				
	MD1A31	[[It doesn't seem to be in a mood to chat.]]								&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1A32	[[Apparently it has nothing to say at this time.]]								&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1A33	[[It doesn't say a word or respond in any way.]]								&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1A41	Oh. You come back for some more, huh? You LIKE me a lot, huh? Yuk, yuk, yuk. Well, you come here and I put a pretty little kiss on you.	MD1A4A	TRUE			You may be two of the most repulsive things I've ever seen. The only thing you are going to be kissing, my fat friend, is the end I sit on.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphMad		
			MD1A4B	TRUE			Hah, hah, hah! You slay me! Hah-hah-hah. I can't stand it. You are one funny hunk of blubber. Hah-hah-hah. Hah-hah-hah. Wait a minute. Have you heard the one about the dragon and the coach seat? Lemme tell you. It's a doozy....	END	MONSTERWAIT_30			
												
	MD1A51	Grr. You want to talk to me, you show some respect. Or maybe I'll pound you.	MD1A5A	TRUE			You have to earn my respect, mallethead.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphMad		
			MD1A5B	TRUE			Sorry. I'm a little irritable. It may have something to do with all the dead things shambling about. Okay. Where I come from, warriors have a little chat before a fight, get to know each other. Then, if you want, we can beat the brains out of each other.	MD1A71				
	MD1A61	I have to make sure you aren't the manling. So I'm going to beat on you a little.  So if you really are a daedra, you can show me while I'm pounding on you.	MD1A6A	TRUE			Come on. I'm a DAEDRA. Anybody can see that. No manling could wade his way through an army of daedra and show up here, fresh as a daisy.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
			MD1A6B	TRUE			Okay, okay. Just a little joke. Sure. I'm the manling. Can't blame me for trying. You're so big and tough, I don't have a chance in a fair fight. So. Might as well have a little chat first. Right?	MD1A71				
	MD1A71	Okay. We talk a little. Then I have to pound on you. And catch you. Alive. Can't forget the alive part. So. What you want to talk about?	MD1A7A	TRUE			Who is your boss, and what are you doing here?	MD1A91				
			MD1A7B	TRUE			I just came from the Battlespire. Nice work. How did it go? Those Battlemages are supposed to be real tough.	MD1A01				
			MD1A7C	TRUE			Where are you supposed to take me after you capture me? Alive. Remember.	MD1B11				
												
	MD1A81	Hah. You think I fall for that old trick? You wear amulet? That don't mean NOTHING. Except you hurt one of my good friends. And that just makes me mad.	MD1A8A	TRUE			Alive. Capture. Remember?	END		&MorphMad		
	MD1A91	Xivilai Moath. He's my boss and he's very important. Mehrunes Dagon likes my boss a lot, because he's so smart and tough. He sent me here to guard this place and look for the manling. He wants the manling. Alive, he said. Okay. We talked. Now we wrestle.	MD1A9A	TRUE			No. You should talk. Makes you feel better. Good exercise for the mind.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
			MD1A9B	TRUE			Sure. I love wrestling.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1A01	Battlespire was a cinch. Traitor opens a gate, we go in, mop things up. Catch Battlemages and guards asleep. Some are pretty tough for manlings, but just a couple. Hundreds of us. Bang, bang bang. Job's done. So rest of troops head home, leave Scamps and Vermai to clean up. Okay. Nice talk. Fun. Now we wrestle.	MD1A0A	TRUE			No. You should talk. Lovely voice. I could listen to you for hours.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
			MD1A0B	TRUE			Sure. I love wrestling.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1B11	Oh. When I capture you, I wait here a while, and someone opens a gate. I don't know how to open gates. So then we take the gate to Shade Perilous, then we take another gate to the Chimera and then home to the Wellhead. Okay. We talk enough? Now we wrestle?	MD1B1A	TRUE			No. Wait. I haven't had a chance to talk yet. It's my turn, isn't it?	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk 		
			MD1B1B	TRUE			Sure. Let's wrestle.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk		
	MD1B21	Capture the manling. Alive. That's what Xivilai Moath said. Capture ALL  the manlings alive. So they talk. Just like the three Battlemages. They talked and talked and talked about all sorts of things. Xivilai Moath MAKES them talk. They were HAPPY to talk. Tell lots of secrets. Xivilai Moath MAKE you talk, too, you bet. Tell all your secrets. So. Now it's pounding time. Ready?	MD1B2A	TRUE			Sure. I'm ready. But don't forget. Capture. Alive. Very important. Wouldn't want to upset your boss.	END	MONSTERATTACK	&MorphNoTalk
