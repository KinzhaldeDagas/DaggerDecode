	DS2B11	Success to the Huntsman whose Race is Won.$ Sweet rest to the Hare whose race is done.$ The Victor calls the View to the Kill, and calls the next Hunt, if that be his Will.	DS2B1A	TRUE			I renounce the Hunt and its rewards. I curse your Hunt, and mock your Law.	DS2B21				
			DS2B1B				I call the Wild Hunt upon the Huntsmen. Hunt Herne and his fellows!	DS2B31				
			DS2B1C				I call the Wild Hunt upon YOU, DARK FIEND!	DS2B41				
			DS2B1D				I call the Wild Hunt ON MEHRUNES DAGON!	DS2B51				
			DS2B1E				I call the Wild Hunt -- UPON MYSELF! HAH-HAH-HAH! Catch me if you can.	DS2B61				
	DS2B21	That is your right, Victor. The Hunt is over. Go in peace, mortal. And pray, manling, that you never meet me again on this world or any other.	DS2B2A	TRUE			Perhaps where you come from, that sort of tough talk may be thought very stylish. If we meet again, you will have more to worry about than style.	END	Teleport_0			
			DS2B2B	TRUE			Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, Batlady.	END	Teleport_0			
	DS2B31	Of course. And under the Law, a fair and just Hunt. Hark, forward, the Innocent Hare. The Hunt is up, and the Game is afoot. Now, excuse me while I give notice to the Hares. By the Law, you may not participate in this Hunt, mortal. Leave this island, if you can, but trouble me no more with your affairs.	DS2B3A	TRUE			Oh, by the way? Could you have the heads mounted and framed? Thanks awfully. Goodbye.	END	Teleport_0			
			DS2B3B	TRUE			Pardon me, Winged One. I did not mean to be a burden. With your permission, I depart.	END	Teleport_0			
	DS2B41	The Hunt may not be Called upon the Master of the Hunt, mortal. I declare your Call foul, and deny the Hunt. You may leave me. Now. While you still enjoy the Sanctuary of the Victor. But touch me, and you forsake your immunity. And know this, mortal. Then I will hunt you down and teach you respect for the Law and your betters.	DS2B4A	TRUE			Oh, goodies. Help after school. You're SO generous with your time and attentions. Until then?	END	Teleport_0			
			DS2B4B	TRUE			You know, threats like that are just IRRESISTIBLE. So. If I touch you, even just a little bit, you are going to Teach Me a Lesson. Oh, may the Blessed Powers give me restraint. 	END	Teleport_0			
	DS2B51	You have missed your calling, mortal. You show an unexpected and not-altogether-welcome gift for comedy. You may not Hunt Lord Dagon, for he may not be summoned upon the grounds of this Hunt by the likes of you. I rule your Call foul, and deny the Hunt. You may leave me. Now. While you still enjoy the Sanctuary of the Victor. But touch me, and you forsake your immunity. And know this, mortal. Then I will hunt you down and teach your respect for the Law and your betters.	DS2B5A	TRUE			Oh, well. I suppose if Lord Dagon will not come to the Hunt, the Hunt must come to him. And perhaps I may see you there, too, Dark Lady? Until then.	END	Teleport_0			
			DS2B5B	TRUE			I bet Lord Dagon is just a big scairdy cat. Sissy britches. Hiding behind the big flying lady's skirts. Ehr. So to speak. No offense, but can't your Lord afford to outfit his minions? Isn't it chilly soaring around in the nude? Bye, now.	END	Teleport_0			
	DS2B61	How interesting. I wondered what might be the source of your courage, your power, your invincibility. And now I know. Your gift is madness. The greatest antagonists are either absolutely competent, or absolutely mad.  I judge your Hunt fair and just under the Law. Hark, forward, the Innocent Hare. The Hunt is up, and the Game is afoot. Flee, mad, wretched mortal, and give us good sport.	DS2B6A	TRUE			Tally ho! Yoicks, and away!	END	Teleport_0
