I've heard that one of the Battlemages is still alive - Clarentavious, I think. I haven't seen him, but then, I haven't had time to look for any secret doors or anything. They wanted him because of some machine or other that's broken. $
Oh, and Methats seems to be the one who's being left in charge, if you're interested. $
Stay close, you might need me! $
