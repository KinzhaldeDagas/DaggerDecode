	GH1A11	Death is the Mother of Beauty.	GH1A1A	TRUE			That's very nice. Very poetic. Thank you for sharing that. I would prefer, however, that you stop trying to kill me. Please?	GH1A31		&GhostNoTalk		
	GH1A12	The seasons turn to winter. In the frozen whiteness, time stands still.	GH1A1B	TRUE			Would you please tell me how to get out of here?	GH1A31		&GhostNoTalk		
	GH1A13	We came this far for beauty. We came this far for love. From this place we can see forever.	GH1A1C	TRUE			You're wasting your breath. So to speak. I'm alive, I like it, and I'm staying that way. Goodbye.	END				
												
	GH1A21	There will be no sad farewells, no tears goodbye. No death stalks this distant shore of peace and love.	GH1A2A	TRUE			Is there any way I can help you? Ease your pain? Release you from the curse that chains you here?	GH1A31		&GhostNoTalk		
	GH1A22	Judge no man, mortal, born to die, happy before his death. In death, all is peace and joy, serene, eternal.	GH1A2B	TRUE			I naturally assume, you being undead and all, that you are suffering terrible anguish and torment. Aren't you? You sure don't seem all that miserable to me.	GH1A31		&GhostNoTalk		
	GH1A23	We lift the veil, and enter into night, eternal night, glorious with stars.	GH1A2C	TRUE			This doesn't seem to be very productive. Goodbye.	END				
												
	GH1A31	[[The ghost glimmers and keens, but does not reply.]]									
												
	GH1A41	Love is stronger than death. He who serves death shall not die.	GH1A4A	TRUE			Words to live by. Hah- hah. That was fun, but it looks like I have to resort to violence. Goodbye.	END				
	GH1A42	Beyond death, there is no fear, no shame. In death, the spirit arises, pure and proud.	GH1A4B	TRUE			Where am I? Who are you guys? Or who were you guys? What's going on here? Can't you just give me a hint?	GH1A31				
	GH1A43	Deep be roots, sturdy be limbs, tough be fibers of bark and heartwood.... but, mortal, before the winds of death, you cannot stand. 	GH1A4C	TRUE			I abjure thee, spawn from beyond the grave! Abomination! Unholy specter! In the name of all that is good and just, I revile thee, and pray for thy destruction!	GH1A31				
	GH1A44	Be assured that death is evil, for were it good, the Gods would ALL die.	GH1A4D	TRUE			This has been very instructive, but I don't want to keep you from your very important work. Whatever it is.	END
