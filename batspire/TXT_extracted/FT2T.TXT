	FT2A11	We are the Lesser Dogs. We Drag the land to flush out the Hare, in accordance with the Laws of the Wild Hunt. 	FT2A1A	TRUE			What ARE you talking about? You're no Lesser Dog. You're a Frost Daedra. You can't fool me.	FT2A21				
			FT2A1B	TRUE			You're pretty low down dog all right.	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
			FT2A1C	TRUE			Are you insinuating that I am a bunny rabbit?	FT2A21				
			FT2A1D	TRUE			I'm the Ice Whacker. I swing my blade to chop ice, in accordance with the Laws of goofy Frost Daedra. 	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
	FT2A21	Grr. We will take special delight in destroying you, mortal! It was YOU who brought down the wrath of the Nocturnals upon our kinsmen! Because of you, all Frost Daedra have been punished for the siege of the Shade Perilous! Because of you, even Frost Daedra who took no part in the siege are lowered in status. We are no longer equals to our kinsmen, the Fire Daedra! The Fire Daedra get to be the GREATER HOUNDS, but we must be the LESSER DOGS. 	FT2A2A	TRUE			By ALL the Powers! How can you BEAR such humiliation?	FT2A01		&Blame		
			FT2A2B	TRUE			I'd cough up a little sympathy, but you guys are TRYING TO KILL ME! I am SICK of your whining. Goodbye.	END	MonsterAttack			
			FT2A2C	TRUE			I'm SO sorry. Does that mean even greater disgrace when I zip through the gates out of here and leave you poor puppies barking in the fog?	FT2A31				
	FT2A31	No way! You. Never. Look. The only way out is through the Temple of Daedric Rites.	FT2A3A	TRUE			Well, I can see where YOU might think that was a big deal, but it's small potatoes to a manling hero like myself.	FT2A41				
	FT2A41	No way! Never. You can't even get INTO Granvellusa with the drawbridge up, and even if you could, you need the six keys.	FT2A4A	TRUE			Come on. I know where the six keys are. That's no big secret.	FT2A61				
	FT2A61	No. WAY! Who told you?	FT2A6A	TRUE			You're not going to trick ME into turning informer! It's not THEIR fault! You know what stupid blabbermouths the Fire Daedra are. No one in their right mind would EVER tell a secret to those clowns.	FT2A71				
	FT2A71	But. But. But. They told you EVERYTHING?	FT2A7A	TRUE			What do you think?	FT2A81				
	FT2A81	About Huntsman Egahirn taking the sixth key, even though it's against the Law? 	FT2A8A	TRUE			Oh, I know it is hard to believe that even the FIRE Daedra could be stupid enough to blab ALL those secrets. But you saw what happened in Shade Perilous. Oh. Sorry. Didn't mean to rub it in. And it wasn't YOUR fault, after all. Oh. Gosh. How the time flies. Got to be going. See you later.	END		&Egahirn		
												
	FT2A91	We are the Lesser Dogs. We Drag the land to flush out the Hare, in accordance with the Laws of the Wild Hunt. While those jerk Fire Daedra get to be the Greater Dogs. Oh. It makes me so mad I could burst!	FT2A9A	TRUE			Hah-hah-hah! Hah-hah-hah! You guys are so dumb! Hah-hah-hah!	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
			FT2A9B	TRUE			Isn't that just the way? Some guys do all the real work, and other guys steal the credit? I makes me so sick I could puke.	FT2A01				
	FT2A01	We would be FAR better Greater Hounds than the Damned Fire Daedra, but THEY have greater status with Mehrunes Dagon now. Harumph! It is not properly LAWFUL! It is not lawful that we Frost Daedra pay the price alone! It is not lawful that our master Xivilai Moath needs must drop in status over the failed siege of the Shade Perilous! Faydra Shardai gave the orders, and WE get punished for carrying them out! Now the Fire Daedra get to become the Chase, and we are nothing but the Drag! Oh, the INJUSTICE! 	FT2A0A	TRUE			That's terrible! How unjust! How unlawful! Extra double super unlawful.	FT2B11		&Tattle		
			FT2A0B	TRUE			For such a powerful supernatural entity, you sure are a big whiner.	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
	FT2B11	Yes! Yes! You understand! You know that this is not lawful! The Fire Daedra should have to be the Drag as well as us! They should be punished too, and not just us!	FT2B1A	TRUE			Puh-LEEZE quit the whining. I know you got a raw deal, but do you have to be such babies about it? Why don't you go kick some Fire Daedra butt?	FT2B51				
			FT2B1B	TRUE			You're so right! Unlawful! It's just UNLAWFUL. Those rotten Fire Daedra should be punished MORE! After all, they cooked up the plan!	FT2B21				
	FT2B21	Yes! It's all their fault! You know it is their fault! You were there! You saw it!	FT2B2A	TRUE			Yep. I know it and you know it. Too bad Dagon doesn't know it.	FT2B31				
			FT2B2B	TRUE			By all the Gods and Powers, I was there. I saw it. It was obvious even to a lowly mortal. Those Fire Daedra made a TOTAL mess of everything.	FT2B31				
	FT2B31	Mortal! You must tell what you know!	FT2B3A	TRUE			To whom? 	FT2B61				
			FT2B3B	TRUE			Oh, like I'm supposed to help you? In case you haven't noticed, I'm being HUNTED here! Look. I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO. Goodbye.	END				
	FT2B51	Human FOOL! That would be unlawful. To fall upon one another like animals? In the middle of the Sacred Hunt? Have you no shame?	FT2B5A	TRUE			Sorry. You're right, of course. What COULD I have been thinking? But doesn't it just burn your buns that the Fire Daedra are placed over you in the Hunt, and that you get punished for THEIR faults?	FT2B21				
	FT2B61	Say what you know in front of the Dark Seducer. That will send the facts directly to Dagon, for she is the Dagon's spy in the realms of-  Aaaargh! You must forget what I said! I must kill you now!	FT2B6A	TRUE			Hold on, buckaroo. I don't care if you ARE evil fiends from the bowels of the Pit. I can't stand by and see such an UNLAWFUL INJUSTICE done. Even to you pitiful whiners. So. Keep your icy blasts to yourself for a bit, and I'll go tell the Dark Seducer what I know. Okay?	FT2B71				
			FT2B6B	TRUE			Fine with me. I'd rather endure your majestic fury than your pathetic whining.	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
	FT2B71	You can? You will? Thank you, manling. You are a creature of Lawful honor.	FT2B7A	TRUE			But first you'll tell me the rules to this Damned Hunt. I mean, it's only LAWFUL, isn't it?	FT2B81				
			FT2B7B	TRUE			Yes. But I need to know the rules to this damned hunt if I'm to survive.	FT2B81				
			FT2B7C	TRUE			No. Just jerking your pitifully short chain. 	END	MonsterAttack	&FrostMad		
			FT2B7D	TRUE			Don't mention it. See you around.	END	Command FT_13			
	FT2B81	Oh. Well. Of course. Most lawful. In accordance with the Law, the Hunt is posted near the ancient stones and before the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. And the Master of the Hunt -- the nasty winged woman with the really big -- you know -- the floppy things -- wings! -- by the Law, she must tell the Hare the rules.	FT2B8A	TRUE			So. These Huntsmen? Isn't this Wild Hunt stuff dangerous? 	FT2B91				
	FT2B91	Oh, no, mortal. Only the Dogs may take hurt in the Hunt. The Law of the Hunt protects the Huntsmen and Master of the Hunt from all mortal weapons. That is the Law.	FT2B9A	TRUE			And extra super Lawful it is, I'm sure. Well, couldn't they get accidentally poked with those weird spears they carry?	FT2B01				
	FT2B01	Oh. Well. I think. Maybe. Yes. No.	FT2B0A	TRUE			I think that covers all the cases quite nicely. Well, thanks. And one more thing. I'd like to go view the architectural triumphs of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. You know. Don't get round here every day. Know how to get in?	FT2C11				
	FT2C11	We do not know! The great Sigil blocks the door, and we can't get in. Only the Greater Hounds and the Huntsmen are allowed in the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. It is so unjust that we be locked out of the Chapel! Unlawful!	FT2C1A	TRUE			Ah, yes. As you said, about a billion times, it is unlawful. Well. A lovely chat. Now I suppose we should get back to chasing around and kicking the daylights out of one another. Ready? Let's go.	END				
												
	FT2C21	[[The icy giant fixes you with piercing contempt and ignores your attempt to speak with him.]]	FT2C2A	TRUE				END

	FT2C41	[[He glares at you with undisguised hatred and gestures threateningly.]]	Ft2C4A	TRUE				END
