	MA3A11	A manling. As promised. For our sport. Very good.	MA3A1A	TRUE			The last Herne who thought I looked like good sport is steaming in the Abyss, clown. You know Egahirn?	MA3A31				
	MA3A12	Oh. Look. An itsy-bitsy eentsy-weentsy toy. Just for us to play with. Isn't our Lady thoughtful.	MA3A1B	&Payem OR &Cess			Hey. Look at the amulet. Ah-ah-ah! Look, but don't touch. So your Ladyship and I Faydra have a little plan. Pity she hasn't seen fit to inform you, but -- I guess that given the way the Hunt worked out, you guys don't smell so sweet, eh?  So keep your distance, and give the Real Operator some room to move.	MA3A21				
			MA3A1C	&Payem OR &Cess			This amulet says keep your hands off. Is that clear? And stay out of my way, or what happened to Egahirn could happen to you.	MA3A41				
			MA3A1D				Look, but don't touch, gristle-wit. I have an important message for Faydra, and she'll give me hell if I get your fat, greasy juices all over it. So do yourself a favor, and get out of my way, or I'll have to tear a hole in you big enough to poke a barrel through.	01-33: MA3A41 34-66: MA3A51 67-00: MA3A71				
	MA3A21	Dogs can wear amulets. And find them in rubbish bins, where they root for their sustenance. Come hither, little dog, and we'll find some nice slops for you to suck.	MA3A2A	TRUE			Okay. You've really stung my pride now. I think I'll hurl myself upon you in a rage. Ready?	END	MonsteraAttack	&HerneMad		
	MA3A31	Yes. Yes. Egahirn is our Oathkin, Playbrother, Lapmate, and Lipfast. What of him?	MA3A3A	TRUE			He fancied himself a Huntsman, but he misjudged the Hare. I just poked him with the Spear of Bitter Mercy, and I think he'll be bouncing around the Cruel, Dark, and Deep for quite a while. So. Anyone else here fancy a wrestle?	END	MonsteraAttack	&HerneMad		
	MA3A41	Yeah? Well, get about your business, mortal, and stop stinking up my air.	MA3A4A	TRUE			You have the nerve to talk about my smell. Have you sniffed those britches you're wearing lately? Oh. Sorry. Not britches. So maybe you could wash that tail of yours. Or shave it.	END	MonsteraAttack	&HerneMad		
	MA3A51	Oh. Oh. Oh. A message for Faydra. Give me the message, NOW, mortal, and I'll let you live.	MA3A5A	TRUE			Oh. Okay. Here's the message. THE LOOT IS IN THE DEEP DARK HOLE TO THE NORTH. EXTRA DOUBLE SECRET. TELL NO ONE. No signature. You know what it means?	MA3A61				
	MA3A61	Hmm. No idea. Excuse me. I think I hear my OathKin calling. North Pit, you say? Yes. Well. Carry on. Faydra's throne room? Well, just ask anyone.	MA3A6A	TRUE			Well. That was easy.	END	Teleport_0			
	MA3A71	Ah. So a message disappears. She'll never know. I just have to have me some HOT FRESH PEOPLE FLESH RIGHT NOW! WHOOPIE!	MA3A7A	TRUE			Would you settle for a couple of handfuls of hair? No?	END	MonsteraAttack	&HerneMad		

	MA3A91	Lady Faydra is gone. I no longer feel the thrill of her in my heart. No, it couldn't be that YOU had anything to do with that, could it, manling?	MA3A9A	TRUE			Hoh. Sure. It was me. I just tossed her Ladyship where the stars don't shine. And good riddance. Mean old witch.	END	MonsterAttack	&HerneMad		
			MA3A9B	TRUE			Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't carry that sort of muscle. And losing her Ladyship kicked some ants into my dinner, too, big boy. We had some plans cooking. So. I was thinking of waltzing over and putting a hurt on Xivilai and his bunch. You up for that?	01-50: MA3A01 51-00: MA3B11				
	MA3A01	Maybe you did Faydra, and maybe you didn't. Doesn't matter to me, now. It's just us, and our personal matters. And time to settle up for what you did to my Oathkin, Egahirn. 	MA3A0A	TRUE			That's old history. But I can see it bothers you. Okay. Let's take care of unfinished business.	END	MonsterAttack	&HerneMad		
	MA3B11	Things are a little confused right now, manling. I think I'll sit this one out, see which way the wind blows. So perhaps a temporary truce is in order. You play nice, and I'll play nice. And later, when things settle down, come see me, and we'll have a nice little chat.	MA3B1A	TRUE			Can't promise anything. But I am feeling a little tuckered out from bursting torsos and ripping off arms. So let's both take a little breather.	END	PCTeam			
												
												
	MA3B21	[[His eyes glow with fury, but he says not a word.]]	MA3B2A	TRUE				END				
	MA3B31	[[He sizes you up as he ignores your offer to parlay.]]	MA3B3A	TRUE				END				
	MA3B41	[[He gazes at you indifferently, and keeps his own counsel.]]	MA3B41	TRUE				END				
	MA3B51	Goodness. What have we here? An ape? A battlemage in donkeyform? An animated manikin for our sport? Now, if it were a manling, then we would have to leave it be, for such are my Lady's orders. But surely, it cannot be the manling, so we may use it for our jests.	MA3B6A	TRUE			Seriously? You don't recognize me? Oh. I see. If that's the way you want to play, it suits me fine.	END	MonsterAttack	&HerneMad
