	WN1A11	You are not stupid, human. So you will listen, and not annoy me with your lies.	WN1A1A	TRUE			I don't like your tone. I'll do as I please, and say what I please, and you'll like it.	WN1A41				
			WN1A1B	TRUE			I would never DREAM of trying to mislead you, your Highness. I hope only to please you.	WN1A51				
			WN1A1C	TRUE			I am listening.	WN1A61				
	WN1A21	So. You have FINALLY brought me SCOURGE and its keyword?	WN1A2A	NOT &Scourge			I'm sorry. I don't have the Scourge.	WN1A71				
			WN1A2B	&Scourge			I'm sorry. I don't have the Scourge.	WN1A81				
			WN1A2C	NOT &Scourge			I have the Scourge, but you shall never receive such a treasure from my hands.	WN1A91				
			WN1A2D	&Scourge			I have the Scourge, but you shall never receive such a treasure from my hands.	WN1A01				
			WN1A2E	NOT &Scourge			I have the Scourge, and will give it to you only after I have the piece of the voidguide you promised in my possession.	WN1B11				
			WN1A2F	&Scourge			I have the Scourge, and will give it to you only after I have the piece of the voidguide you promised in my possession.	WN1B21				
	WN1A31	So. Are you ready to listen respectfully?	WN1A3A	TRUE			No.	END	HealthHalf, PainSFX	&WonshalaMad		
			WN1A3B	TRUE			Yes	WN1A61				
												
	WN1A41	Sometimes I AM wrong, stupid human. Maybe pain will make you more civil.	WN1A4A	TRUE			…and maybe not.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX	&WonshalaMad		
	WN1A51	YOU LIE! Listen, maggot, or I'll school your flesh to respect.	WN1A5A	TRUE			With respect, you're a silly old witch, and I thumb my nose at your tiresome blather.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX	&WonshalaMad		
			WN1A5B	TRUE			So say something worth hearing, Highness.	WN1A61				
	WN1A61	I have a piece of the voidguide. I will trade it for a  weapon called SCOURGE. It's here on Battlespire, and its functions are protected by a magical warding keyword, but that's all I know. Deliver me SCOURGE, and provide me with the keyword, and you shall have your voidpiece.	WN1A6A	TRUE			No chance. If you have a voidguide piece, I'll take it from you. And I'd never give you anything you wanted, anyway.	END		&WonshalaMad		
			WN1A6B	TRUE			I hear you. 	END		&WonshalaTask		
			WN1A6C	TRUE			I agree. So keep your troops out of my hair, and I'll be back that much faster.	END		&WonshalaTask		
	WN1A71	I won't speak with you until you have SCOURGE.	WN1A7A	TRUE			Fine.	END				
	WN1A81	I detest lying fools. I will not listen to your lies.	WN1A8A	TRUE			Fine.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
	WN1A91	Perhaps you think your lies and mocking tone amuse me? Can pain persuade you otherwise?	WN1A9A	TRUE			I think we'll get a chance to find out.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
	WN1A01	I am scarcely impressed by your pretense of defiance. Either you will trade the SCOURGE for the voidguide, or we have nothing to talk about.	WN1A0A	TRUE			We'll SEE if my defiance is nothing but pretense, Highness.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
	WN1B11	I am not even slightly curious about the trick you think you will play on me. I can scarcely summon interest in your response to a dose of educational pain.	WN1B1A	TRUE			You'll be sorry. It was a really cute trick.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
	WN1B21	I will now hand you the piece of the voidguide with one hand while I accept SCOURGE with my other hand. As we each grasp these valued objects, you will tell me the keyword, and I will activate SCOURGE to prove that you have not tried to give me a false keyword.	WN1B2A	NOT &Mischief			Nuts. The keyword. Forgot all about it. Getting that should be EASY. Back in a jiffy.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
			WN1B2B	NOT &Mischief AND NOT &Malacath			I agree. Here is SCOURGE. And the keyword is… Malacath!	WN1B31				
			WN1B2C	&Mischief			Hmm. Double hmm. Ohh, NO!  I COMPLETELY  forgot. I have to TEST that password first, right? Or you'll give me another educational jolt. So excuse me	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX			
			WN1B2D	&Mischief			I agree. Here is SCOURGE. And the keyword is… Equality!	WN1B41	TAKE 7_2017 AND PUT 30_10000			
												
	WN1B31	SCOURGE, I invoke thee in the name of Malacath.... Hmm. Perhaps that is not the keyword. An honest mistake, I'm sure. Perhaps a sharp reminder of my wrath will focus your mind.	WN1B3A	TRUE			Thank you, your Highness.	END	HealthHalf AND PainSFX	&Malacath		
	WN1B41	SCOURGE, I invoke thee in the name of Equality.... YES! 	WN1B4A	TRUE			Satisfied, Highness?	WN1B51				
	WN1B51	And with this power, I may now rid myself of your irksome stink... But... what... oh... OHHHH, GODS!	WN1B5A	TRUE			Farewell, Highness. I hear that a lengthy vacation in the Outer Darkness is a splendid tonic for the nerves.	END	Kill
