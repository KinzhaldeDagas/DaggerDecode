[[Among a group of notes you find the following hand-written note:]]

Jaciel --

Are you aware that some of the Seducers have been meeting in the Chapel of Reflections? I felt distinctly that I was not welcome. I have seen other secretive and furtive behavior from these recruits that makes me anxious.

I know you have accepted these Lordless Daedra as retainers. In fact, I strongly advocated their case to you. You are most generous in affording them protection, and shrewd in recruiting warriors of ancient craft and skill. But I begin to doubt the wisdom of retaining agents of such doubtful loyalty. Perhaps this is a risk we cannot afford.

Please speak with me about this at your earliest convenience.

Love,
Deyanira
