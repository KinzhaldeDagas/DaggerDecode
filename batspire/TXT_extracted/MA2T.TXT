	MA2A11	I am the Huntsman. I hunt you in accordance with the laws of the Wild Hunt. Tremble before your death! 	MA2A1A	TRUE			I'm quaking in my boots, I guarantee you. Now how about calling off this Hunt? I think I could make it worth your while.	MA2A31				
			MA2A1B	TRUE			Is there any way, short of killing you, that I can persuade you to let me use the gate out of here?	MA2A31				
			MA2A1C	TRUE			Look. I'm on my way to the Havok Wellhead. I'm going past you, or through you. You think you're invulnerable. But the secret surprise is that I can knock you so far into Oblivion that even your kin forget your name.	MA2A21				
			MA2A1D	&Spear			Look here. See? I have my own pretty Spear of the Bitter Mercy. Now. One last chance. Clear out, or you're smoke.	MA2A41				
	MA2A21	How do you expect me to fall for such an obvious bluff?	MA2A2A	TRUE			Because, as you may know, on this island is the only mortal I know who has ever bested Dagon. And guess who has vouchsafed me the secret of your inevitable doom? 	MA2A31				
	MA2A31	You waste your breath, and my patience. Die, mortal!	MA2A3A	TRUE			Your right. I'm wasting my breath. Goodbye.	END				
	MA2A41	That thing? That wouldn't even fool a Scamp. Well. Perhaps. It does look remarkably like a real Spear. I salute you. A magnificent bluff. And it will make a good tale at the feast. But now, all good things must end, including you, my pretty little Hare.	MA2A4A	TRUE			Mallethead. I wish you could comprehend your doom. It would make my triumph all the sweeter. But dumb stones do not comprehend. Goodbye, Huntsman.	END				
												
	MA2A51	[[Apparently the daedra has nothing to say to you.]]	MA2A5A	TRUE				END				
	MA2A61	[[The daedra looks almost fondly upon you, but doesn't say a word.]]	MA2A6A	TRUE				END
