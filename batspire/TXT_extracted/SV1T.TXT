	SV1A11	Why should we fight? Perhaps there is something you want… something I'd be happy to give you…	SV1A1A	TRUE			Nothing a repulsive creature like you could say could be of any possible interest to me	END	MONSTERATTACK	&VornMad			
	SV1A12	I enjoy a challenge, and a good workout… but more stimulating  exertions  might satisfy us both.	SV1A1B	TRUE			That sounds good to me. Let me get comfortable…	SV1A51	DROPREADYWEAPON AND UNEQUIPARMOR				
	SV1A13	Your form is pleasing, mortal. To mar such grace with weapons is a pity… I'd far prefer to wrestle.	SV1A1C	TRUE			I admit… I like what I see, and your proposal is appealing… but what assurance can you give of my safety if I make myself more… accessible to you?	END	MONSTERATTACK				
	SV1A21	I can't die, mortal. Are you sure you want to risk YOUR all too fragile skin?	SV1A2A	&Voidguide			Good point. But I can't leave. Just give me the voidguide, and I'll withdraw immediately.	SV1A61					
	SV1A22	Defeat me, and I taste bitter Oblivion… but I WILL return. For you, there is no return from death. Is this affair worth such risks?	SV1A2B	&PCFemale			That's a difficult question. But I can't abandon a friend. Please… tell me where Josian Kaid is, and I swear you'll have no further trouble from me.	SV1A71					
	SV1A23	What reward can balance the chance of a sleep from which you will never wake?	SV1A2C	&PCMale			That's a difficult question. But I can't abandon a friend. Please… tell me where Vatasha Trenelle is, and I swear you'll have no further trouble from me.	SV1A81					
			SV1A2D	TRUE			I am a great fool, I concede, and terrified of death. Buth, then again, at least I serve whom I choose, and am no creature's slave.	END		&VornMad			
			SV1A2E	&MethatsName			I know my risk, though I thank you for your concern. I am curious, though. What do YOU fear? Why do you serve Methats? Have you no pride?	SV1A91					
	SV1A31	Don't waste your breath, fleshchild… you'll miss it when it's gone.	SV1A3A	TRUE			Sound advice. Do your worst, helspawn.	END	MONSTERATTACK 				
	SV1A41	[[Licking its lips, it grins at you mockingly.]]		TRUE					MonsterAttack				
	SV1A42	[It peers at you curiously as if it were studying a curious animal.]]		TRUE					MonsterAttack				
	SV1A43	[[It shows little interest in speaking with you.]]		TRUE					MonsterAttack				
													
													
	SV1A51	Ahhh…. You are everything I dreamed of. Now, let ME give you something I KNOW will please you…	SV1R1YBA	TRUE			I can't wait….	END	Health_2 AND FeebleDelay_120 AND PleasureSFX				
			SV1R1YBB	TRUE			Uh… well… maybe… 	END	MONSTERATTACK 				
	SV1A61	I have no idea where the voidguide is… but I do know where I put one piece of it. And I also know you won't be getting your hands on it.	SV1R2YAA	TRUE			I guess I'll just have to settle for a piece of the voidguide… and maybe a piece of you, while I'm at it.	END	MonsterAttack				
	SV1A71	Josian Kaid… we both want Josian Kaid. Excuse me, but… finder's keepers….	SV1R2YBA	TRUE			We'll see about that.	END	MonsterAttack	SVNoTalk			
	SV1A81	Vatasha Trenelle…  we both want Vatasha Trenelle. Excuse me, but… finder's keepers….	SV1R2YCA	TRUE			We'll see about that.	END	MonsterAttack	&SVNoTalk			
	SV1A91	Methats? He's a toad. I serve Wonshala, and not out of fear, but in heat, hunger, and delight.	SV1S2YEA	TRUE			Oh. Well, I'll be sure to let Wonshala know if we should meet.	END	MonsterAttack
