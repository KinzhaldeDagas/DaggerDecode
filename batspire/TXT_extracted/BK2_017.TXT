Malham's Annotated Compendium of Arcane Contrivances of the Second Age, Volume IV

Just as it is necessary for the state to prepare arms and to provide abundant stores of victuals for the soldiers who are to fight for it, so it is fitting for Imperial Servants to fortify themselves against the assaults of pagans and heretics with a multitude of sound writings. So all know, and Malham speaks. $
