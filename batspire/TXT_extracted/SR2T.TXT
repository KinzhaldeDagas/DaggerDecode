	SR2A11	What DO you think you're doing, you -- wait -- are  you -- 	SR2A1A	TRUE			Yes! You see your doom before you. Flee while you still can.	END	MONSTERFLEE_120	&SeduceNoTalk		
	SR2A12	Things are pretty much under control here, though a few of the more stubborn Sisters are still hiding -- but -- you aren't --	SR2A1B	TRUE			What? Afraid a little manling will hurt you? Come on. We're on the same side. Relax. Can you tell me how to get out of here?	SR2A21				
	SR2A13	You're not Frost. Or Fire. Or Dremora. So what -- oh -- not --	SR2A1C	TRUE			Don't judge by appearances. I take this form to confuse my prey. Quickly. A manling is loose. He seeks the exit portal, and we may trap him there. Go, show me the way, and I will follow as best I can in this form.	SR2A21				
	SR2A21	CURSE the GODS, it IS the manling!	SR2A2A	TRUE			Yes! Behold the BOLD MANLING, and TASTE FEAR! I -- hey. Where are you going?	END	MONSTERFLEE_120	&SeduceNoTalk
