  I've done the character pointer array list of games...

  It's accessed via the variable 'networkGames' (I think :)

  Calling the GenerateGameList function will update the networkGames
  list.  U can call it around once a second to keep it well updated.

  All my stuff is in source safe.  If you get it, you will also need
  to get the netgine.lib file (under spire\libs) and the netgine.h
  file (under spire\source\headers) and new files which are network.c
  and network.h.  I've updated several files like extern.h, intro.c,
  game.c, etc.

  To compile you'll need to update ur makefile and makelist.lnk files
  to compile network.c and link in with netgine.lib.

  I think that's about it.

  BTW I commented out PlaySound in intro.c... that is a new thing
  you must have added that it cannot find anywhere when I compile it.
