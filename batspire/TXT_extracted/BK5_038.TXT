We the Dremora are true to our word. $
This place is closed to us, and the help we can provide is limited. $

You are now in the place of the Hunt. $
To leave this realm you must enter the gate in the great horned temple, in the walled city to the East. $
You will require six keys to enter the temple. If the Hunt were fair, you would find them abroad in the island. $
The Hunt is not fair. $
The hunter has taken one to prevent your escape. The touch of his spear is death, and no mortal weapon can harm him. $

Your plight is utterly hopeless and impossible. $
Therefore we assume that you may be somewhat delayed. $

The old man in the lonely cottage knows what you need. He will test your patience, but persist and the reward will be great. $

Farewell, strange mortal. Enjoy the Hunt. $
