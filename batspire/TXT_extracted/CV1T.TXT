	CV1A11	At last! O, joy! Saved! Saved! Oh, I knew you'd come, I've waited SO LONG in all this desperate, terrible nightmare.	CV1A1A	TRUE			Hang on. Who in Mara's hat are YOU?	CV1A21				
			CV1A1B	&Journal			Ah. You look old and wise to me. So. You must be the wizard Clarentavious. Right?	CV1A31				
			CV1A1C	TRUE			Keep your voice down! These Daedra DO have EARS you know!	CV1A21				
	CV1A21	What? Do you know who you're talking to, you whelp? I am Clarentavious, the Emperor's chief artificer, and the only battlemage left alive in this Powers-forsaken wasteland.	CV1A2A	TRUE			Forgive my -- curiosity -- but -- by what coincidence do you alone remain unharmed? 	CV1A31				
			CV1A2B	TRUE			Hah. So what kind of a deal did you have to cut with the daedra to keep your skin?	CV1A31				
			CV1A2C	&Journal AND PCFemale			Have you seen Josiah Kaid?	CV1A41				
			CV1A2D	&Journal AND PCMale			Have you seen Vatasha Trenelle?	CV1A51				
	CV1A31	I persuaded them I was Taken and BOUND to them, ensorceled, ONE of them. But I'm not, I'm not...and now you're HERE! And safety, sweet escape, and an END to the nightmare, and the darkness -- erm,   but -- where are the legions, to cleanse this realm of its infestation?	CV1A3A	TRUE			Legions? Well. Well. Uh. I ehr um. Well. No legions. Just. Well. You see? I'm all there is. Here. At the present.	CV1A61				
	CV1A41	Kaid? They wanted Kaid, they sought him here but it's just me, just old Clarentavious, in the dark. But.  Where are the LEGIONS to rid this place of its infestation?	CV1A4A	TRUE			The legions will be here quite soon. Certainly. They sent me on ahead, of course, to, well, scout out things. A bit.	CV1A71				
	CV1A51	Trenelle? They wanted Trenelle, they sought her here but it's just me, just old Clarentavious, in the dark. But.  Where are the LEGIONS, to rid this place of its infestation?	CV1A5A	TRUE			The legions will be here quite soon. Certainly. They sent me on ahead, of course, to, well, scout out things. A bit.	CV1A71				
	CV1A61	No legions? Just you? And what use are you? USEless! USEless! All is lost! The Weir Gate is barred, and the Star Galley; that can only bear us deeper into the darkness and the madness. Well. That's the end, then. Here. The password to my chambers is "boustrophedon." It's on a piece of parchment somewhere around here. Take the password, and go to my chambers. Sever the last anchor, and we shall be done.  You will reach them through a Mystic Conveyor, if you can get past Methats, that is.	CV1A6A	TRUE			EEE-Easy, friend. What's all this about a star galley? A stove for cooking stars?	CV1A81		&MethatsName		
	CV1A71	I'm not that far off in the weeds, young whippersnapper! You've got no legions, and none are coming. The Weir Gate is barred, and the Star Galley, that can only bear us deeper into the darkness and the madness. Well. That's the end, then. Here. The password to my chambers is "boustrophedon." It's on a piece of parchment somewhere around here. Take the password, and go to my chambers.  Sever the last anchor, and we shall be done. You will reach them through a Mystic Conveyor, if you can get past Methats, that is.	CV1A7A	TRUE			Erm --  exactly what is implied by the significant phrase -- we shall be DONE?	CV1A81		&MethatsName		
	CV1A81	You come strolling through here,  you don't have a legion, and you know jack-all! Nothing! Go to my chambers. All your questions will be answered there. Then you'll taste of utter  despair. Now begone, and let me make my peace with my ancestors.	CV1A8A	TRUE			Right. I'm off to your chambers straight away, where all will be made clear. I'm sure. Perhaps I'll check back later to share your utter despair.	END		&Dismissed		
	CV1A91	You again! Why is the anchor still intact? Have - you - learned - NOTHING?	CV1A9A	TRUE			Look, there has to be SOME way out of here.	CV1A01				
			CV1A9B	TRUE			Just what did you mean about all that er, sever the anchor and we'll be DONE business?	CV1A01				
			CV1A9C	TRUE			What was it I was supposed to do, again?	CV1A01				
			CV1A9D	&CogPage			I've been to your rooms and I've read your note. Where are the rest of the cogs?	CV1B11				
	CV1A01	Are you DEAF as well as WITLESS? Let me try very small words. Use. The.  Password. Use. The. Teleporter. Go to my chambers. Go to my chambers. Go. To. My. Chambers. ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED THERE. Now GO!	CV1A0A	TRUE			Right. Thank you.	END		&Dismissed		
	CV1B11	So now you see. They are too strong, and the Star Galley just delivers us among more powerful foes. As for the cogs? Gone. Lost. Scattered into the hands of the Enemy. It matters not. Make your peace with the Great Powers, and sever the final anchor. Hope is lost. All that remains is an honorable death.	CV1B1A	TRUE			Ahah! You little conceive with whom you speak. For I have just recently been awarded SECOND PLACE in the Imperial Martial Arts competition.	CV1B21				
			CV1B1B	TRUE			Well, age brings wisdom, they say. Suit yourself. I have other fish to fry.	END		&Dismissed2		
			CV1B1C	TRUE			Consider, Aged Father. I might have a chance against these fiends if you were to lend me the TYPOS SOPHIA!	CV1B31				
	CV1B21	Second place? Oh, good. Good. That's very encouraging. Now. Please. Set free the last anchor, and we can end this tragedy with stoic dignity.	CV1B2A	TRUE			I've had just about enough of your sunny disposition. Go pop the anchor yourself, old man. I've got some valiant servants of the Emperor to avenge.	END		&Dismissed2		
			CV1B2B	TRUE			Consider, Aged Father. I might have a chance against these fiends if you were to lend me the TYPOS SOPHIA!	CV1B31				
	CV1B31	You must be MAD! That Methats! HE'll be in my MIND! Drawing my soul through TORMENT! Sucking me DRY! He'll PEEL MY SKIN FROM MY BONES!	CV1B3A	TRUE			Okay, okay. Take it easy. I'll get along fine without it. Goodbye.	END		&Dismissed2		
			CV1B3B	TRUE			Look. What if I did Methats for you? Knocked him into Oblivion, or the Thirteen Hells, or wherever Daedra go when you smack their spirits right out of time and space?	CV1B41				
	CV1B41	You're priceless! So naive! Yes. Cast Methats from the world, and I'll give you the Typos Sophia! Absolutely. Why not? While you're about it, bring me his right pauldron, where he wears his seal, as proof of your deed. Might as well grab the seals of the Thirteen Patrons and the Eight Powers while you're at it. Hah-hah-ha! Hah-hah-hah!	CV1B4A	TRUE			That's better. Cheer up. No need to be gloomy. I'll be right back with the dingus. Goodbye.	END		&Dismissed2		
			CV1B4B	&Pauldron			What, you mean, like THIS pauldron HERE?	CV1B51				
	CV1B51	By the Powers! You amaze me! Very well. Take the Typos Sophia. Much good may it do you in the Colleges. But you shall see. Yes, you'll see soon enough. These creatures you see here are but pups compared with their masters. As you dangle for eternity in some daedric pit of horrors, you'll wish you'd taken my advice and died gloriously with me in the ruins of Battlespire.	CV1B5A	TRUE			Look, old man. Hide here in closet if you must, but don't kill yourself and don't set Battlespire drifting off to ends of time. SOMEone has to stick around here and report to the legions. So tighten up. I'll see you later.	END	Put 13_1010	&ClarenDone		
	CV1B61	What now? Have you finally seen sense? Are you ready to put an end to it? Or perhaps you have Methats' PAULDRON AND SEAL? Hah-hah-hah! Hmmmm?	CV1B6A	TRUE			I see I'll get no more sense out of you until I DO have it. Goodbye for now.	END				
			CV1B6B	&Pauldron			What, you mean, like THIS pauldron HERE?	CV1B51				
	CV1B71	[[He seems to have withdrawn deep within himself and won't be talking with anyone for quite a while.]]		TRUE				END
