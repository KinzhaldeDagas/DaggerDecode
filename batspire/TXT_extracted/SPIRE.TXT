#0000
This spell will summon a monster at random roughly equivalent in
level to the caster. The monster will appear near the caster and will
attack any creatures in the area except for the caster.

#0001
Use this spell to detect any delayed spell and also any spell cast by
anybody in the vicinity of the caster.

#0002
When this spell is operational it will point out the nearest monster
to the caster. This includes other player in multiplayer mode.

#0003
Using this spell allows the caster to see invisible objects without
difficulty.

#0004
This will turn the caster invisible for a specific duration or until
he attacks somebody.

#0005
The effects of this spell serve to change the caster into shadow. The
caster will still be marginally visible in brightly lit areas but
almost totally invisible in near darkness.

#0006
This causes the caster to blend with his surroundings making him very
hard to spot. The caster will cause a slight distortion to the
background.

#0007
By changing the weight of the character he will fall as light and as
slow as a feather preventing him from taking damage from any fall.

#0008
The recipient of this spell will take periodic damage for the
duration of the spell.

#0009
This injects a potent poison into the victim. This poison is not
magical and cannot be removed by dispel magic.

#0010
This will make the controls work erratically for the unfortunate
recipient for the duration of the spell.

#0011
While not only draining the target it will actually transfer whatever
was drained to the caster.

#0012
This is your basic magical mine. This will stay where it was left for
a period of time or until someone trips it taking damage.

#0013
This will bring up a list of all spells active on the caster and in
the immediate vicinity, including other players, and allows the
caster to terminatye any single spell from that list.

[[A stained glass window depicts, to one side, many people laboring hard, burdened with great loads, and suffering the agonies of war and death. On the other side the people put down their burdens and are transfigured by a blazing green light which strips them of their tattered soiled garments and leaves them in a perfect splendor of body and spirit. Beneath the window is a simple inscription:]]

THE SOUL CAIRN^
Once they struggled, hammered, cried^
Fought for justice, honor, pride.^
Now from time and tide released^
They guard and serve in silent peace^

[[A lengthy inscription identifies one of the Master's retainers who came to the Soul Cairn to die and be reborn in his Eternal Service.]]

Good work! The Battlespire is destroyed. On the plus side, it can no longer be used by the Daedra for their own foul ends. On the minus side, both it and you are now doomed to drift endlessly through the cold, dark void where there is nothing much to do, or eat, or anything, except die a long and lingering death. Would you like to try again?

#1035
Unfortunately you languish in a dungeon, forgotten and ignored, with the dubious consolation that your substance will nourish the squeaking, long-tailed vermin who are your final companions.

#1036
True to her word, Faydra Shardai makes your substance proof against time, which means you will be conscious through the eternity of torment she has planned for you. And your rewards indeed are no less than those of the boldest of her lieutenants - the bold lieutenants who dare to challenge her authority, the bold lieutenants who share your never-ending misery and despair. 

#1037
On the indispensable Anchors and the absolute need of their perpetual preservation.
For the edification and admonition of all that should pass through this hall. 
Know that this is one of the five great Anchors that moor the Battlespire in its place and retain it in the life-flood of sustaining Mana, without which there would be no light, no life, no Being. 
In their o'er-reaching wisdom, the Administration has required me, against my every protest and complaint, to affix to it a dreadful device, which you see before you, whose purpose is to sunder and divide this anchor and imperil the Spire and all who inhabit it.

Never divide the Anchor. It is the rock upon which all our lives are founded. All Anchors must be conjoined to assure the safety and stability of the Spire.

Above all, never, never, never allow them all to be unloosed. Sure destruction shall follow, as the Battlespire departs the flux that keeps all sides of nature in unity. 

Now avaunt, and quit this chamber, lest the imp of temptation, or some unhappy humour overcome you, and lead you onto the path of certain annihilation.

C.V.

The Mock Turtle introduces himself as a member of the rare species of Great Turtle from which is made the famous Mock Turtle Soup, the Soup of Kings.

"Sit down and don't say a word until I've finished. Once," said the Mock Turtle with a deep sigh, "I was a real Turtle."

The Mock Turtle relates a tragic and lengthy tale about going to school in the sea, and about his studies in the obscure disciplines of the Quadriva Arithmetia - Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision -- and the courses of instruction in Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography, Drawling, Stretching, Fainting in Coils, Laughing, and Grief.

At last, when it becomes clear that his story has no point, you become restless.

"Oh, dear," said the Mock Turtle. "I'm afraid I've bored you. You've been so kind to listen to the maunderings of an ancient reptile... please say my name backwards where it will do the most good, accept as a token of my gratitude a product of my researches in the field of Speculative Ontology."
