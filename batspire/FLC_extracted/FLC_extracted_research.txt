FLC_extracted Research Notes
============================
Location examined: batspire/FLC_extracted
Date: autogenerated from repository scan

1) Folder inventory
-------------------
- Total files in folder: 164
- FLC animation files: 163
- Non-FLC files: 1 (ADR.TXT)
- ADR.TXT content: "435223"

2) Naming pattern findings
--------------------------
- All .FLC files follow this structure:
  <2-letter character code><TALK|WAIT><2-digit variant>.FLC
  Example: DKTALK01.FLC, FSWAIT93.FLC
- Parsed files matching this exact pattern: 163/163
- Unique 2-letter character codes discovered: 30

3) TALK/WAIT distribution
-------------------------
- TALK files: 74
- WAIT files: 89
- WAIT variants are more common than TALK variants.

4) Size profile (FLC files only)
--------------------------------
- Combined size: 93,022,082 bytes
- Average size: 570,687.62 bytes
- Median size: 492,132 bytes
- Smallest file: RLWAIT01.FLC (243,414 bytes)
- Largest file: ZZTALK00.FLC and ZZWAIT00.FLC (1,783,788 bytes each)

5) Most represented character codes
-----------------------------------
Top codes by total file count (TALK+WAIT):
- FS: 18
- DK: 16
- SR: 12
- JM: 12
- ZN: 9
- SM: 9
- XM: 9
- SA: 7
- DR: 7
- SK: 7

6) High-number WAIT variant observations
----------------------------------------
- WAIT variants using 90+ suffixes were found in 13 files.
- These appear only for DK, FS, and JM code groups in this dataset:
  DKWAIT90-94, FSWAIT90-94, JMWAIT90-92.

7) Per-code breakdown (TALK count/range and WAIT count/range)
--------------------------------------------------------------
- FS: TALK 8 (00-93), WAIT 10 (00-94)
- DK: TALK 6 (00-92), WAIT 10 (00-94)
- SR: TALK 5 (00-04), WAIT 7 (00-06)
- JM: TALK 6 (00-92), WAIT 6 (00-92)
- ZN: TALK 4 (00-03), WAIT 5 (00-04)
- SM: TALK 4 (00-03), WAIT 5 (00-04)
- XM: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 6 (00-05)
- SA: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 4 (00-03)
- DR: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 4 (00-03)
- SK: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 4 (00-03)
- IM: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 3 (00-02)
- CF: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 3 (00-02)
- WN: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 2 (00-01)
- CH: TALK 3 (00-02), WAIT 2 (00-01)
- RL: TALK 2 (00-01), WAIT 2 (00-01)
- CV: TALK 1 (00), WAIT 2 (00-01)
- DS, FR, FT, DL, SN, MD, ML, ZZ, MA, WR, VM, GV, GH, SD:
  TALK 1 (00), WAIT 1 (00) each.

Interpretation summary
----------------------
- This folder is a dense set of dialogue/idle animation clips keyed by 2-letter character IDs.
- The TALK/WAIT split and repeated code families strongly suggest these are portrait-style
  conversational animations with multiple variants per speaker.
- A few code families include extended/special WAIT sets in the 90+ range, likely reserved for
  unique states or alternate animation loops.
